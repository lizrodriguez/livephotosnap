I've decided to create an image gallery using Apple Live Photos. Live photos are taken with the iPhone 6/6S/7 and include movement before and after the picture is taken. Apple's [Live Photos JavaScript API](https://developer.apple.com/live-photos/) was recently released in April, so thought it would be fun to view Live Photos instead of regular images. Once the Live Photo is uploaded, a user can click on the ID of the image and be shown the make and model of the iPhone used as well as the location of where the image was taken.

The techology I've used in the project are:

[PureCSS](https://purecss.io/) for styling

Node.js

Express

PostgreSQL

[exif-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exif-js) to extract JPG metadata

[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to display the map

[LivePhotosKit JS library]((https://developer.apple.com/live-photos/))
